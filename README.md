# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is from kaggle (Winter Olympic Medals 1924 - 2018). 

It has records of medals in Olympic Editions from 1924 to 2018.

Here is one entry from this dataset - 

{
  "Year": 1924,
  "Host_country": "France",
  "Host_city": "Chamonix",
  "Country_Name": "United States",
  "Country_Code": "USA",
  "Gold": 1,
  "Silver": 2,
  "Bronze": 1
}

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which are the countries with the highest number of medals?
 * How did the country perform over the years?
 * Relation between all the countries and number of medals.

I chose to modify stacked bar graph according to the sample available on the VizHub -

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data.

## Milestones

* Week 1 - World Map
* Week 2 - Line graph
* Week 3 - Line graph with user input
* Week 4 - Stacked bar graph
  

## Project Self-Critique and Reprioritization 
### 1 - Does the visualization answer these questions or facilitate these tasks? 
    I would say the visualization will answer most of the questions.
    a. Which are the countries with the highest number of medals? - Answered by World map, Stacked Bar Graph and Regular bar graphs
    b. How did the country perform over the years? - This is answered by line graph
    c. Relation between all the countries and number of medals - I don't think this is a good question to base off a visualization off of. 
    I should rephrase this question better. But for now, this too is answered by world map

### Reprioritization

    I would like to add option to select more than one country in the line chart, so user can compare performances of the countries over the year.
    I would also like to rearrange the data in stacked bar graph so it ordered.
    This is based on the feedback I received. I would go through other peer reviews and see if anything might also apply to my vizzes. 


## Progress made as of April 16 - 

1. Arranged stacked bar graph according to the total number of medals.
