# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is from kaggle (Winter Olympic Medals 1924 - 2018). 

It has records of medals in Olympic Editions from 1924 to 2018.

Here is one entry from this dataset - 

{
  "Year": 1924,
  "Host_country": "France",
  "Host_city": "Chamonix",
  "Country_Name": "United States",
  "Country_Code": "USA",
  "Gold": 1,
  "Silver": 2,
  "Bronze": 1
}

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which are the countries with the highest number of medals?
 * How did the country perform over the years?
 * Relation between all the countries and number of medals.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
