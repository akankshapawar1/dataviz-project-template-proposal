# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is from kaggle (Winter Olympic Medals 1924 - 2018). 

It has records of medals in Olympic Editions from 1924 to 2018.

Here is one entry from this dataset - 

{
  "Year": 1924,
  "Host_country": "France",
  "Host_city": "Chamonix",
  "Country_Name": "United States",
  "Country_Code": "USA",
  "Gold": 1,
  "Silver": 2,
  "Bronze": 1
}

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which are the countries with the highest number of medals?
 * How did the country perform over the years?
 * Relation between all the countries and number of medals.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 

1. Scatter plot to represent the number of participant countries over the years

2. Bar graph representing countries which have won the most medals

3. World map which displays the number of medals won by that country over the years

## Open Questions

1. In my first sketch, I want to give an option to the user to select the number of countries they want on the bar graph. Is there existing example on Vizhub which has done this before?

## Milestones

* Week 1 - Line graph
* Week 2 - Stacked bar graph
* Week 3 - Stacked bar graph with user inputting the number of countries
* Week 4 - Representing the data on a globe instead of a 2D map
