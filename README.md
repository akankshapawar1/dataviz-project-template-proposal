# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is from kaggle (Winter Olympic Medals 1924 - 2018). 

It has records of medals in Olympic Editions from 1924 to 2018.

Here is one entry from this dataset - 

{
  "Year": 1924,
  "Host_country": "France",
  "Host_city": "Chamonix",
  "Country_Name": "United States",
  "Country_Code": "USA",
  "Gold": 1,
  "Silver": 2,
  "Bronze": 1
}

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which are the countries with the highest number of medals?
 * How did the country perform over the years?
 * Relation between all the countries and number of medals.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 

1. Scatter plot to represent the number of participant countries over the years
